PHProxy 0.0.1
Copyright (C) 2002 Kieran Simkin - kieran@lv6.net

This is the first version of PHProxy, it's still far from finished.
However, various elements are entirely usable and it'll run fine on
most servers.

As yet, this is the only documentation for PHProxy, there will
be a lot more coming very soon with a more mature version. 

To install phproxy, just copy getpage.php, getfile.php, 
geturl.php and start.html into your apache document root directory 
and make sure you have the latest version of PHP installed 
(I use 4.1.1). You will need to edit a few lines of the 
scripts, namely:

line 57 of getfile.php, replace http://slinky.lv6.net/getpage.php 
with the location of getpage.php on your server.
line 14 of getpage.php, change the location or your log file.
lines 84, 89, 109, 114, and 144 of getpage.php, replace
http://slinky.lv6.net/getpage.php with the location on your 
server.
line 3 of geturl.php to point to the location of getpage.php
on your server.

Edit the references to the cache directory and give www-data or whatever
apache runs as permission to write to that directory.

To test v3, load up a browser and point it in the direction of
start.html, enter an address and hit go.

Any problems will have to wait, when PHProxy is in a more usable
state I'll probably start writing real documentation, till then
you will have to figure everything else out for yourself.
